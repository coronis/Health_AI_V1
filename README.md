Mission

- Build and ship a launch‑ready, secure, scalable, AI‑powered health coach with native iOS and
  Android apps, real backend, n8n orchestration, accurate nutrition/fitness engines, privacy‑first
  AI, and CI/CD.
- This README is aligned to PROMPT_README_COMBINED.md (SSOT) and APPLICATION_PHASES.md (Phases
  0–15). No placeholders or demo stubs. Secrets never in code.

Important Note about Architecture Update

- Earlier drafts described a Flutter + FastAPI stack. Per PROMPT_README_COMBINED.md and
  APPLICATION_PHASES.md, the target architecture is:
  - Native iOS (SwiftUI) + Android (Jetpack Compose)
  - Backend: Node.js (NestJS + TypeScript)
  - Orchestration: n8n
  - Vector store: Postgres + pgvector (or OpenSearch)
- This README reflects the target architecture and the atomic monorepo needed to deliver it
  end‑to‑end. Where existing code differs, see “Migration Notes” near the end of this document.

Overview

- Personalized nutrition and fitness planning (celebrity‑grade), with accurate TDEE/macros/micros,
  GI/GL, cooking transforms.
- Weekly adaptive loop using logs and wearable data.
- Health report pipeline (OCR → NER → interpretation) with Level 1 highest accuracy policy.
- Domain‑scoped chat with RAG grounded in user data, report interpretations, and curated domain
  knowledge.
- India‑first UX and data sources; Hinglish inputs; global scaling target 10M+.

Non‑negotiables

- Level 1 vs Level 2 AI policies (accuracy vs cost) strictly enforced by AI Router and n8n.
- Security/privacy by design: no client‑side secrets, DLP/pseudonymization for external AI calls,
  zero‑retention vendor flags.
- Performance and reliability: p95 API < 2s, mobile launch < 3s, graceful degradation, offline
  caching.
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA; large tap targets; dynamic type; screen reader labels.

  - Health Report Ingestion (OCR → NER → Interpretation)
  - Daily Plan Runner and Weekly Review/Adaptation
  - Notifications Scheduler (hydration/meals/workouts/AQI)
  - Quota Reset (daily ladder reset for Level 1)
- AI Router:
  - Level 1 (health reports, report Q&A): always highest accuracy first with daily tier step‑down;
    never below Level 2 without explicit consent.
  - Level 2 (diet/fitness/recipes/chat): cheapest within 5% of top accuracy; prefer
    open‑source/self‑hosted where feasible.
  - DLP/pseudonymization; zero‑retention flags; decisions logged with model, version, cost, quota
    state.

RAG & Domain‑Scoped Chat

- Vector store: pgvector on Postgres (or OpenSearch).
- Indexed corpora: user profile/preferences/goals/logs/measurements, structured health report
  extracts, plan summaries, curated nutrition/fitness knowledge.
- Chat answers only domain‑scoped questions; provides citations where applicable; update operations
  require explicit user confirmation; audits recorded.

Health Report Pipeline (Level 1)

- OCR/DU (primary best‑in‑class per region) with fallbacks; table/section extraction.
- NER + normalization for biomarkers; units/ranges by age/sex.
- Interpretation: anomalies, trends, plain‑language summaries; physician red‑flag triggers.
- Privacy: encrypted storage; no raw image logs; zero‑retention providers; DLP enforced.

  Manager; WAF/bot protection/rate limiting; data export/delete flows.
- Observability: OpenTelemetry tracing, structured logs, metrics; SLO dashboards; synthetic checks;
  alerting; runbooks; DR tests.
- Cost controls: model usage dashboards; quotas; cache hit metrics; provider mix optimization per
  Level 1/2 policy.

Design System

as‑is.

Key Policies

AI Model Routing (Level 1/2)

- Level 1 (health reports; report‑focused chat)
  - Always select the highest‑accuracy model; daily quota ladder: 100% → 98% → 97%… Never below
    Level 2 without consent.
  - Cache structured interpretations; reuse via RAG to reduce cost while maintaining fidelity.
- Level 2 (diet/fitness/recipes/general chat)
  - Choose the cheapest provider within 5% of the top accuracy; prefer open‑source/self‑hosted where
    feasible (Llama/Mistral/Qwen).
- All AI calls
  - DLP: redact/pseudonymize PII/PHI; enforce zero‑retention/no‑log modes where supported; record
    model, version, cost, quota state.

Testing Strategy

- Engines: deterministic unit tests vs reference datasets; ≥85% coverage; ≥90% on critical paths by
  Phase 15.
- Integration: provider mocks, ETL jobs, OCR/NER parsers, AI router decisions.
- Mobile: UI snapshot tests; E2E flows (onboarding → plan → logging → analytics → chat).
- Performance: load/soak tests; cache effectiveness; p95/p99 latencies.
- Security: SAST/DAST; fuzz parsers (OCR text); auth abuse scenarios; DLP verification.

CI/CD

- GitHub Actions workflows (backend, mobile-ios, mobile-android, infra, security, release).
- Branch protection with required checks (lint, tests, coverage, security scans).
- Release pipelines for stores; crash reporting (privacy‑conscious); staged rollouts; rollback
  plans.

Runbooks

- Provider outage: switch to fallbacks; reduce Level 2 cost; increase cache TTLs; notify users with
  banners.
- Quota exhaustion (Level 1): step‑down tier; reuse cached interpretations; delay non‑critical
  report reprocessing; inform users.
- Incident response: triage, comms, mitigation, post‑mortem.

Migration Notes (from earlier README variants)

- Previous drafts used Flutter (mobile) and FastAPI (backend). This updated architecture follows the
  agreed SSOT and phases (native iOS/Android; NestJS backend; n8n orchestration; RAG; Level 1/2
  policies).
- If parts of the repo still reflect Flutter/FastAPI, treat them as transitional. Create migration
  issues to:
  - Stand up native mobile app projects with shared design tokens and migrate feature flows.
  - Bootstrap NestJS backend with domain modules and ports to existing APIs where feasible.
  - Introduce n8n workflows for AI router and pipelines; move any “AI orchestration in code” into
    n8n where policy requires.
- Do not store secrets in mobile clients or repos. Update infra to use Secrets Manager and
  environment‑based configuration.

Contributing

- Conventional commits; PR template and CODEOWNERS apply.
- Any changes to PROMPT_README_COMBINED.md or APPLICATION_PHASES.md require synchronized updates and
  product/security/AI lead approvals.
- Ensure tests, lint, security scans pass before merge.

- MIT (see LICENSE)

Acknowledgments

- Built to clinical‑grade standards where applicable for nutrition/fitness logic, with strict
  privacy and safety policies.
