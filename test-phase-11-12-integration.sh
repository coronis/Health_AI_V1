echo "1. User uploads blood test report (PDF/image)"
echo "2. Phase 11 processes report:"
echo "   - OCR extracts text: 'HbA1c: 7.2%'"
echo "   - Entity extraction identifies: HbA1c = 7.2 (diabetic)"
echo "   - Health interpretation flags: 'Type 2 Diabetes - dietary management required'"
echo "3. User requests meal plan"
echo "4. Phase 12 integrates health data:"
echo "   - Retrieves HbA1c = 7.2% → isDiabetic = true"
echo "   - Generates dietary recommendations: lowGlycemicIndex = true"
echo "   - AI prompt includes: 'PRIORITIZE LOW GLYCEMIC INDEX foods (GI < 55)'"
echo "   - Generates diabetes-friendly meal plan with GI/GL calculations"
