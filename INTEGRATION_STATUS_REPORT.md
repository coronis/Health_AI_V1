## 🏗️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### API Service Layer

```typescript
// Centralized API client with authentication
src / services / api.ts;

// Domain-specific service integrations
src / services / mealPlanningService.ts;
src / services / chatService.ts;
src / services / healthReportsService.ts;
```

### State Management

```typescript
// Custom React hooks for API operations
src/hooks/useApi.ts

// Features:
- useApiCall() - Basic API calls with loading/error states
- useAutoFetch() - Automatic data fetching on mount
- useDebouncedApiCall() - Debounced calls for search
- useFormSubmission() - Form handling with API integration
```

### Type Safety

- ✅ **Full TypeScript integration** with backend service interfaces
- ✅ **Type-safe API calls** preventing runtime errors
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling** with user-friendly messages

---

## 🔒 SECURITY & DOMAIN RESTRICTIONS

### AI Chat Domain Enforcement

The AI chat assistant is now **properly restricted** to health-related topics:

**✅ ALLOWED TOPICS**:

- Nutrition and diet planning
- Fitness and exercise guidance
- Health condition management
- Meal logging and analysis
- Wellness and lifestyle advice

**❌ BLOCKED TOPICS**:

- General conversation
- Non-health related queries
- Personal information unrelated to health
- Commercial or promotional content

### Data Privacy

- ✅ **PII redaction** for external AI calls
- ✅ **Token-based authentication** ready for production
- ✅ **No client-side secrets** - all sensitive data server-side
- ✅ **Vendor data-retention disabled** for health data protection
