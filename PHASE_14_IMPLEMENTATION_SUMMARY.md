### Prompt Optimization Architecture

```typescript
// Example optimized prompt execution
const result = await promptOptimizationService.executePrompt(
  userId,
  PromptCategory.NUTRITION_ADVICE,
  { userQuery: 'Help me plan meals for diabetes management' }
);

// Automatic variable replacement:
// {{userName}} â†’ User's name from profile
// {{healthConditions}} â†’ "diabetes" from health data
// {{dietaryPreferences}} â†’ "vegetarian" from preferences
// {{userGoals}} â†’ "blood sugar management" from goals
```
