âœ… Usage tracking for all AI interactions  
âœ… Quota monitoring and limit enforcement  
âœ… Domain restriction context in chat requests  
âœ… Visual domain restriction notice in UI  
âœ… Cost optimization recommendations  

### 3. **Domain Restrictions Implementation** (Complete)

#### Enforced Restrictions:
âœ… **Allowed Topics**: health, nutrition, fitness, diet, mental wellbeing, meal planning, recipes  
âœ… **Blocked Topics**: weather, politics, entertainment, technology news, finance, gaming, etc.  
âœ… **Automatic Redirection**: Out-of-scope questions redirected to health topics  
âœ… **Clear User Communication**: Both apps show domain restriction notices  

#### Backend Integration:
âœ… Uses existing `DomainScopedChatService` with proper keyword filtering  
âœ… Out-of-scope message handling with helpful redirection  
âœ… Domain classification with confidence scoring  

### 4. **AI Cost Optimization Rules** (Complete)

#### Cost Tracking Features:
âœ… **Token Usage Monitoring**: Tracks tokens per request and user  
âœ… **Daily/Monthly Quotas**: Enforces usage limits with warnings  
âœ… **Cost Metrics**: Real-time cost tracking and analysis  
âœ… **Optimization Templates**: Uses cost-efficient prompt templates  
âœ… **Batch Processing**: Groups requests for cost efficiency  

#### Platform-Specific Implementation:
- **iOS**: SwiftUI interface with cost metrics dashboard
- **Android**: Material Design cost tracking with progress indicators
- **Backend**: Existing cost optimization service integration

## ðŸš€ Key Integration Points

### API Endpoints Used:
- `POST /chat/message` - Send domain-restricted messages
- `GET /chat/sessions/{id}/history` - Retrieve chat history
- `POST /chat/suggested-questions` - Get contextual suggestions
- `GET /ai-prompt-optimization/cost-metrics` - Cost tracking
- `GET /ai-prompt-optimization/quota-status` - Usage limits
- `POST /ai-prompt-optimization/track-usage` - Usage logging

### Domain Restriction Implementation:
```typescript
// Backend domain validation
allowedDomains = ['nutrition', 'fitness', 'health', 'meal_planning', 'recipe', 'general_wellness']
outOfScopeKeywords = ['weather', 'politics', 'entertainment', 'finance', ...]

// Mobile app context
context: {
  "domain_restriction": "health_nutrition_fitness_only",
  "cost_optimization": "enabled"
}

// User preferences
domainFocus: ["health", "nutrition", "fitness", "diet", "mental_wellbeing"]
```

### Cost Optimization Rules:
1. **Quota Enforcement**: Daily limits with graduated warnings
2. **Template Optimization**: Uses pre-built prompts for common queries
3. **Batch Processing**: Groups similar requests for efficiency
4. **Usage Tracking**: Monitors tokens, costs, and success rates
5. **Automatic Fallback**: Switches to optimized templates when approaching limits

## ðŸ“± User Experience

### iOS Experience:
- **Clean SwiftUI interface** with native iOS design patterns
- **Domain restriction notice** prominently displayed
- **Cost optimization dashboard** accessible from chat menu
- **Real-time quota status** in chat header
- **Suggested questions** filtered by health categories
- **Smooth animations** and loading states

### Android Experience:
- **Material Design 3** interface with consistent theming
- **Enhanced header** with domain restriction notice
- **Cost optimization integration** with existing chat flow
- **Visual quota indicators** and warnings
- **Improved error handling** for cost limits

## ðŸ”’ Security & Privacy

### Domain Security:
âœ… **Server-side validation** of all chat requests  
âœ… **Keyword filtering** prevents off-topic responses  
âœ… **Context validation** ensures health-focused conversations  
âœ… **Automatic redirection** for out-of-scope queries  

### Cost Protection:
âœ… **Quota enforcement** prevents excessive usage  
âœ… **Usage tracking** for audit and optimization  
âœ… **Rate limiting** built into backend services  
âœ… **Template optimization** reduces unnecessary costs  

## ðŸ”„ Consistency with Existing Architecture

### Matches Web App Pattern:
âœ… Same API service architecture across platforms  
âœ… Consistent data models and interfaces  
âœ… Same error handling patterns  
âœ… Same domain restriction enforcement  
âœ… Unified cost optimization approach  

### Leverages Existing Backend:
âœ… Uses established `DomainScopedChatService`  
âœ… Integrates with existing `CostOptimizationService`  
âœ… Follows established authentication patterns  
âœ… Uses existing RAG and AI routing infrastructure
