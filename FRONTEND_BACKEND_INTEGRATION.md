- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### API Services Created:
1. `src/services/api.ts` - Core API client with authentication
2. `src/services/mealPlanningService.ts` - Meal planning API integration
3. `src/services/chatService.ts` - Chat API integration
4. `src/hooks/useApi.ts` - React hooks for API state management

#### Key Features:
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during API calls
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and retry options  
- **Authentication**: Token-based auth ready for production
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces matching backend models
- **Responsive Design**: Maintained accessibility and mobile responsiveness

### üéØ Domain Restrictions Implemented

The AI chat is now properly restricted to health-related topics:
- ‚úÖ Nutrition and diet planning
- ‚úÖ Fitness and exercise guidance  
- ‚úÖ Health condition management
- ‚úÖ Meal logging and analysis
- ‚ùå General conversation topics
- ‚ùå Non-health related queries

### üìä Performance & UX

- **Build Success**: All TypeScript compilation passes
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with minimal increase
- **User Experience**: Smooth loading states and error recovery
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures

### üîå Backend Service Dependencies

The frontend now expects these backend endpoints to be available:

#### Meal Planning Service:
- `POST /api/meal-plans/generate` - Generate personalized meal plan
- `GET /api/meal-plans/current/{userId}` - Get current meal plan
- `POST /api/meal-plans/swap-meal` - Get meal alternatives
- `PATCH /api/meal-plans/{id}/apply-swap` - Apply meal swap

#### Chat Service:
- `POST /api/chat/sessions` - Create chat session
- `POST /api/chat/message` - Send message
- `GET /api/chat/sessions/{id}` - Get session details
- `POST /api/chat/suggested-questions` - Get suggested questions

### üöÄ Next Steps for Full Production

1. **Environment Configuration**: Set up proper API URLs and authentication
2. **Backend Deployment**: Deploy the NestJS backend services  
3. **Database Setup**: Configure PostgreSQL with proper schemas
4. **AI Service Keys**: Add production AI service API keys
5. **Testing**: Integration testing with real backend services

This integration represents a major milestone in transforming the HealthCoach AI application from a static demo to a production-ready, AI-powered health platform.
