# Security and Privacy Policy

## Overview

HealthCoachAI is committed to implementing security and privacy by design across all aspects of our application. This document outlines our comprehensive security and privacy framework aligned with OWASP ASVS controls and global privacy regulations.

## Security Framework

### OWASP ASVS Alignment

We implement security controls based on OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Level 2, with Level 3 controls for critical components handling health data.

#### Key Security Domains:
- **V1: Architecture, Design and Threat Modeling**
- **V2: Authentication**
- **V3: Session Management**
- **V4: Access Control**
- **V5: Validation, Sanitization and Encoding**
- **V6: Stored Cryptography**
- **V7: Error Handling and Logging**
- **V8: Data Protection**
- **V9: Communication**
- **V10: Malicious Code**
- **V11: Business Logic**
- **V12: Files and Resources**
- **V13: API and Web Service**
- **V14: Configuration**

### Data Classification

#### Tier 1: Critical Health Data (PHI/PII)
- Health reports and lab results
- Medical conditions and diagnoses
- Biometric measurements
- Genetic information

**Protection Measures:**
- AES-256 encryption at rest with KMS

### Authentication and Authorization

#### Multi-Factor Authentication
- Phone OTP for primary authentication
- OAuth integration (Google, Apple, Facebook)
- Device binding for enhanced security
- JWT with short-lived access tokens
- Refresh token rotation

#### Access Control Model
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Standard user roles
- **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)**: Context-aware permissions
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews and recertification

### Cryptography Standards

#### Encryption at Rest

- **mTLS** for service-to-service communication
- Certificate pinning for mobile applications
- HSTS enforcement

#### Key Management
- Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for key generation
- Centralized key management via Cloud KMS
- Key versioning and rotation
