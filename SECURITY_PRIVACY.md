## üõ°Ô∏è Security Principles

### Core Security Principles

1. **Security by Default**: All systems are secure by default
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary access for all operations
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
4. **Zero Trust**: Verify every request and transaction
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting

### Design Principles

- **Fail Securely**: System failures default to secure state
- **Complete Mediation**: All access attempts are checked
- **Open Design**: Security through proven methods, not obscurity
- **Separation of Duties**: Critical operations require multiple approvals
- **Economy of Mechanism**: Simple, well-understood security controls
