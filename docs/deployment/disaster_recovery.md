# Disaster Recovery Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the disaster recovery procedures for HealthCoachAI to ensure business continuity and data protection in the event of system failures, natural disasters, or security incidents.

## Recovery Objectives

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- **Critical Services**: 4 hours
- **Core Application**: 8 hours  
- **Full Service Restoration**: 24 hours
- **Non-critical Services**: 72 hours

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- **User Data**: 15 minutes (continuous replication)
- **Application Data**: 1 hour (hourly backups)
- **Configuration Data**: 24 hours (daily backups)
- **Analytics Data**: 24 hours (acceptable loss window)

## Disaster Categories

### Category 1: Service Degradation
- Single service outage
- Partial database corruption
- Network connectivity issues
- **Response Time**: 30 minutes
- **Expected Resolution**: 2-4 hours

### Category 2: Major Outage
- Multiple service failures
- Database cluster failure
- Data center outage
- **Response Time**: 15 minutes
- **Expected Resolution**: 4-8 hours

### Category 3: Complete Disaster
- Total data center loss
- Major security breach
- Natural disaster
- **Response Time**: Immediate
- **Expected Resolution**: 8-48 hours

## Infrastructure Architecture

### Multi-Region Setup
```yaml
Primary Region: us-east-1
  - Production workloads
  - Primary database cluster
  - Real-time replication to secondary

Secondary Region: us-west-2
  - Standby infrastructure (warm)
  - Cross-region database replicas
  - Automated failover capabilities

Tertiary Region: eu-west-1
  - Cold backup storage
  - Compliance data residency
  - Emergency fallback option
```
