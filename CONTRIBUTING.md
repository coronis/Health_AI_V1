## üîÑ Contributing Workflow

### 1. Choose an Issue

- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` for your first contribution
- Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it
- Ask questions if anything is unclear

### 2. Create a Branch

Use the following naming convention:

- `feature/description` - for new features
- `fix/description` - for bug fixes
- `docs/description` - for documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - for refactoring
- `test/description` - for test improvements

### 3. Make Changes

- Follow our coding standards (see below)
- Write tests for your changes
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all tests pass

### 4. Commit Your Changes

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
# Format: type(scope): description
git commit -m "feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration"
git commit -m "fix(mobile): resolve navigation issue"
git commit -m "docs(api): update authentication endpoints"
```

Types:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### 5. Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Then create a pull request using our PR template.

## üéØ Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer `type` over `interface` for new definitions
- Use type imports: `import type { User } from './types'`
- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` or proper types
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Organization

- Follow the established folder structure
- Keep files focused and single-purpose
- Use barrel exports in `index.ts` files
- Group related functionality together

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: `kebab-case.ts`
- **Folders**: `kebab-case`
- **Variables**: `camelCase`
- **Constants**: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Types**: `PascalCase`
- **Components**: `PascalCase`

### Code Style

- Use functional programming patterns where appropriate
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic only

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ component.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ component.test.ts        # Unit tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ component.integration.ts # Integration tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __tests__/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ component.e2e.ts     # E2E tests
```

### Testing Standards

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain > 90% coverage for critical paths
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/components
2. **Integration Tests**: Test module interactions
3. **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows
4. **Performance Tests**: Test for performance regressions
